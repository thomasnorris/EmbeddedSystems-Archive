# EmbeddedSystems
- Switch branches to change projects.
    - The `master` branch contains starter code for all projects, but code is updated on a branch-per-project basis.
- All of these projects were created/edited with [Keil uVision 4.74 for ARM, MDK-Lite (32KB) Edition](https://www.keil.com/demo/eval/armv4.htm) and should probably be opened with that.
